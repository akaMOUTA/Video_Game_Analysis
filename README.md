Hello, my name is Christos, this is my first Analysis, I hope you like it.

This project is a made for me to show my entry level skills using R, it still needs some polishing but it is good for now.
With this analysis I wanted to show the best selling Video Games from the 80's up until the 16's and the differance between the Critic's score and the User's score, how we as User like our Video games and what do Critics think is a good game.
